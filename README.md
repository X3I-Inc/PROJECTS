# Test-repo
This repository contains all significant projects from my portfolio, showcasing my expertise in game development, software engineering, and electronics. 
Each project demonstrates various technical skills and innovative solutions, complete with source code and documentation for easy exploration and understanding.

You are free to use any of them in your own developments and projects, but I would really appreciate if you would contact me befre using them.
